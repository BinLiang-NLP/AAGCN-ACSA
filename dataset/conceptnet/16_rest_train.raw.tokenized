this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york .

what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .

at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .

i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .

each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .

as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .

i ' m a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .

his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
